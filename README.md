## ðŸš€ How It Works

Just run the script in **Powershell 7 or newer**, and it will:

1. Ask you for a URL
2. Ask for a name for the output file
3. Check if a logo.png file exists and add it to the center (will be resized to fit in the center. If you don't want a logo, please use the /otherversions
/QRGenerator.ps1 script instead!) 
4. Generate both:
   - A **terminal preview** using ASCII
   - A **PNG file** with customizable design
5. Ask if you'd like to generate another
