# ðŸ“¸ PowerShell QR Code Generator

A quick QR code generator I made for my partner at their request. Pull requests welcome.

## âœ¨ What it can do~

âœ… Generate **high-quality QR codes** from URLs   
âœ… Output as PNG<br>
âœ… **Terminal preview** as ASCII art to confirm creation of QR code worked <br>
âœ… Add **custom logo overlays** (png)<br>
âœ… Customize colors<br>
âœ… You can create multiple QR codes in a row!<br>
âœ… Works in **PowerShell 7+**<br>

## ðŸš€ How It Works

Just run the script in **Powershell 7 or newer**, and it will:

1. Ask you for a URL
2. Ask for a name for the output file
3. Check if a logo.png file exists and add it to the center (will be resized to fit in the center.
   - If you don't want a logo, please use the /otherversions/QRGenerator.ps1 script instead!)
   - Make sure to move the script to the root folder, otherwise it won't parse the required DLL 
5. Generate both:
   - A **terminal preview** using ASCII
   - A **PNG file** with customizable design
6. Ask if you'd like to generate another
